# Initialization - December 23, 2025

## What happened

Initialized the graft-knowledge repository following the meta-knowledge-base pattern:

- Created KB structure (docs/, notes/, knowledge-base.yaml)
- Established entrypoints for humans and agents
- Documented initial architecture concepts
- Recorded first decision (initial scope)

## Current state

The knowledge base now has:
- Configuration: `knowledge-base.yaml` linking to meta-knowledge-base
- Documentation:
  - `docs/architecture.md` - Draft architecture overview
  - `docs/decisions/decision-0001-initial-scope.md` - Scope definition
- Entrypoints:
  - `docs/README.md` - Human entrypoint
  - `docs/agents.md` - Agent entrypoint with curator guidance

## Key decisions made

1. **Narrow initial scope**: Focus on task runner + git-centered dependencies
2. **Avoid over-engineering**: Start simple, add complexity when validated
3. **Git-native approach**: Leverage git for versioning and distribution

## Next steps

This KB is ready for evolution. Future work might include:

- Refine architecture based on prototype development
- Document dependency resolution algorithm
- Add decision records as tradeoffs emerge
- Create notes for weekly explorations and progress

## Open questions

- What's the exact format for `graft.yaml` configuration?
- How should lockfiles work?
- What's the dependency resolution algorithm?
- How to handle transitive dependencies?

## Sources

- Meta knowledge base: [../../meta-knowledge-base/docs/meta.md](../../meta-knowledge-base/docs/meta.md)
- Initial scope decision: [../docs/decisions/decision-0001-initial-scope.md](../docs/decisions/decision-0001-initial-scope.md)
