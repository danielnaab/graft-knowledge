# Grove Specifications

Living specifications for the Grove workspace management tool.

## What is Grove?

Grove is a workspace management tool for working with multiple git repositories as a unified workspace. It provides multi-repo status, quick capture with routing, cross-repo search, graft-aware dependency visualization, and agentic integration via CLI.

## Reading Guide

Specifications follow the [living-specifications](../../../.graft/living-specifications/) methodology. Each spec has: Intent, Non-goals, Behavior (Given/When/Then scenarios with edge cases), Constraints, Open Questions, Decisions, and Sources. Behavior headings are tagged with `[Slice N]` to connect to the [vertical slices](../../../notes/2026-02-06-grove-vertical-slices.md) implementation plan.
